#### [An Astronaut's Guide to Life on Earth](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18170143-an-astronaut-s-guide-to-life-on-earth)
**Author: Chris Hadfield**<br style="line-height: 0.5;">
**Rating: 4 star**

The book isn't really a "guide" but more of the author's life story on how he became an astronaut and some super amazing anecdotes from his time in the space. Having wanted to be an astronaut for a long part of my childhoold (since seeing the Columbia explosion live) and then my military school upbringing + fighter pilot ambitions, it really was amazing to read about the life Chris has lived (with a slight pang of "what if" for my own life)

Nevertheless, it is sparkled with nuggets of wisdom here and there, that I have tried to capture below. My biggest reflection though was just understanding the author as a person and his insatiable ambition in life. I sometimes feel that my own ambition in life has really reduced and reading up on Chris' story was just an alarming wake up call. In one of his [Reddit AMAs](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18pik4/i_am_astronaut_chris_hadfield_currently_orbiting/), he says:

> [!NOTE]
> _Decide in your heart of hearts what really excites and challenges you, and start moving your life in that direction. Every decision you make, from what you eat to what you do with your time tonight, turns you into who you are tomorrow, and the day after that. Look at who you want to be, and start sculpting yourself into that person. You may not get exactly where you thought you’d be, but you will be doing things that suit you in a profession you believe in. **Don’t let life randomly kick you into the adult you don’t want to become.**_

If I can take one thing away from this book, it has to be the utmost ambition and discipline with which Chris lived and continues to live his life. Next time I am in a tough spot (career or just not doing that one extra rep in the gym), I intend to ask myself:

>  **What would Chris do?**

#### Some verbatim notes for my reference:

In my experience, fear comes from not knowing what to expect and not feeling you have any control over what’s about to happen. When you feel helpless, you’re far more afraid than you would be if you knew the facts. If you’re not sure what to be alarmed about, everything is alarming.

Early success is a terrible teacher. You’re essentially being rewarded for a lack of preparation, so when you find yourself in a situation where you must prepare, you can’t do it. You don’t know how.

Or of whining. My dad could be a stern taskmaster and on principle didn’t believe children should complain, but he also disapproved of whining because he understood that it is contagious and destructive. Comparing notes on how unfair or difficult or ridiculous something is does promote bonding—and sometimes that’s why griping continues, because it’s reinforcing an us-against-the-world feeling. Very quickly, though, the warmth of unity morphs to the sourness of resentment, which makes hardships seem even more intolerable and doesn’t help get the job done. Whining is the antithesis of expeditionary behavior, which is all about rallying the troops around a common goal. - *as someone who sometimes engages in the regular bitching about your boss and sees the importance of whining bringing people closure, this perspective was very refreshing. I have never thought about the negative aspects of this mentality.*

It’s counterintuitive, but I think it’s true: promoting your colleagues’ interests helps you stay competitive, even in a field where everyone is top-notch. And it’s easy to do once you understand that you have a vested interest in your co-workers’ success. - *Play long-term games with people. If this is true in a super competitive field like Astronauts, it better be true for my life.*

In a crisis, the “why” is irrelevant. I needed to accept where I found myself and prioritize what mattered right that minute.

Fortunately, we also knew the boldface that could save us: focus on the journey, not on arriving at a certain destination. Keep looking to the future, not mourning the past.

Over the years, I’ve realized that in any new situation, whether it involves an elevator or a rocket ship, you will almost certainly be viewed in one of three ways. As a minus one: actively harmful, someone who creates problems. Or as a zero: your impact is neutral and doesn’t tip the balance one way or the other. Or you’ll be seen as a plus one: someone who actively adds value. Everyone wants to be a plus one, of course. But proclaiming your plus-oneness at the outset almost guarantees you’ll be perceived as a minus one, regardless of the skills you bring to the table or how you actually perform. This might seem self-evident, but it can’t be, because so many people do it. - *aim to be the zero to actually be a plus one*

When you have some skills but don’t fully understand your environment, there is no way you can be a plus one. At best, you can be a zero. But a zero isn’t a bad thing to be. You’re competent enough not to create problems or make more work for everyone else. And you have to be competent, and prove to others that you are, before you can be extraordinary. There are no shortcuts, unfortunately. Even later, when you do understand the environment and can make an outstanding contribution, there’s considerable wisdom in practicing humility. If you really are a plus one, people will notice—and they’re even more likely to give you credit for it if you’re not trying to rub their noses in your greatness.

It was also a big part of what made him a plus one on our crew. Not only did he bring a wealth of experience and knowledge, but he conducted himself as though no task was beneath him. He acted as though he considered himself a zero: reasonably competent but no better than anyone else.

The ideal entry is not to sail in and make your presence known immediately. It’s to ingress without causing a ripple. The best way to contribute to a brand-new environment is not by trying to prove what a wonderful addition you are. It’s by trying to have a neutral impact, to observe and learn from those who are already there, and to pitch in with the grunt work wherever possible.

One benefit of aiming to be a zero: it’s an attainable goal. Plus, it’s often a good way to get to plus one. If you’re really observing and trying to learn rather than seeking to impress, you may actually get the chance to do something useful.


If you start thinking that only your biggest and shiniest moments count, you’re setting yourself up to feel like a failure most of the time. Personally, I’d rather feel good most of the time, so to me everything counts: the small moments, the medium ones, the successes that make the papers and also the ones that no one knows about but me. The challenge is avoiding being derailed by the big, shiny moments that turn other people’s heads. You have to figure out for yourself how to enjoy and celebrate them, and then move on. - *very very important. Don't live on your past laurels or purely chasing the next laurel*
