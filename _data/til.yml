  title: "Bluetooth has a 'sniffing' mode to magically connect with switched-off devices"
  details: |
    Most Bluetooth devices even when "asleep" can receive your other BT device's connection request and magically "wake up". For e.g. your laptop can connect with your switched off bluetooth speaker.

    The speaker is in "sniffing" mode where a tiny part of its bluetooth radio is kept on to periodically "sniff" for incoming BT connection requests. A pre-paired device remembers each other's BT addresses and can therefore connect to each other magically. This also ensures that no non-paired devices can just randomly wake up your bluetooth speaker.

  title: "Your Mac has a built-in job scheduler!"
  details: |
    Knowing this means you can potentially "program" your laptop to do X things at Y time of the day every Z days. This fact, merged with Claude Code Skills, effectively means you can setup complicated workflows in a recurring manner all natively on your Mac, with no need to access any server based service like n8n, github actions etc.

    There are 2 built-in job schedulers in Mac: `Cron` and `Launchd`. Cron will miss stuff out if your laptop is "off" at the time of the job. Launchd can queue in stuff so even if a job is missed, it will re-activate the next time your Mac wakes up.
