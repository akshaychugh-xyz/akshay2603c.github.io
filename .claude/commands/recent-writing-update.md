I will give you a post. 
Go to /Users/akshaychugh/GitHub/akshay2603c.github.io/index.markdown and find the ## Recent Writings section. Replace the most outdated post in that section with the new post I give you.
Once the index.markdown file is updated, i want you to open a jekyll local server at <bundle exec jekyll serve> so that I can test the changes.
