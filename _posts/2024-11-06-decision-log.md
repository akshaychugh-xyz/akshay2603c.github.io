### Maintain a decision log?

The goal of a good product/business person should be to **improve product/business sense.**

This product/business sense, however, can just be a fancy way of saying the ability to make good decisions with insufficient data - the mythical "listening to your gut".

Therefore, the way to improve at this decision making process, like most things in life, is to get in as many **"reps"** as possible of making decisions and then reflect strongly on the outcomes.

A good way to accelerating the reps part is by looking at other companies, what they are doing, hypothesize why they are doing what they are doing and what would you do if you were them. Then look back 3-6-12 months later and see if your decisions were correct.

> Hence, the need to maintain a "decision log" - where you make decisions and come back to reflect.
