ðŸ‘‹ Hola amigo, I am Akshay Chugh, and thank you for checking out my website!
  
    
      
        
I use this space to document my life learnings - be it work _(growth and product for web2 and web3)_, fitness _(triathlon, weights, squash, nutrition)_ or just shower thoughts about life in general. 

Hope you have a good time and see you around!
