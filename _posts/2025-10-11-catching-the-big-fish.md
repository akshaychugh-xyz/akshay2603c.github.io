#### [Catching the Big Fish](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58169.Catching_the_Big_Fish)
**Author: David Lynch**
**Rating: 3 star**

A book that doesn't really tell you anything but I just got this this feeling that the author is glowing from within. I don't know how to describe why I felt this, I just did. Essentially serves as a great sub-conscious pitch to try out Transcendental Meditation (TM) - i just booked an intro slot at a center near me.

- Ideas are like fish. If you want to catch little ideas, you can stay in shallow water. But if you want to catch the big ones, you need to go the deep water
- An interesting thing about people who meditate is that a LOT of them claim to have not missed a day in sooo many years. The author for e.g. has not missed a day in 33 years 😱!
- Creativity needs time. You need to just sit and be. Otherwise, if you know you have to get somewhere in 30 mins, you can't achieve anything. Similar to [[Deep Work]] idea, where you need some time to achieve "flow state". You can't really do anything in a 30mins slot.
- Fifty years ago, people were saying "things are speeding up". 20 years ago also the same. Now, even more so. It always feels so.
	- The author spent 5 years on his first film. He delivered wall street journal on the side.
	- Keep your eye on the doughnut, not on the hole. Just focus on your thing.
- Meditation has to be experienced. You can't just read about it. And reading about it feels like something magical, but just so out of your reach.
