# You are average, but so are your problems

![You are average, but so are your problems](/assets/images/you-are-average.png)

Growing up, I always thought I was the centre of the universe. That I was created to do something special. Like life was literally a movie, and I was the lead actor. Everyone else was the supporting cast in "my movie". It probably stemmed from being good in academics, which had a disproportionate weightage growing up.

All that, of course, came crashing down when *real* life hit. I grew up, faced multiple failures, saw people much more talented in literally every field and I realised how I am not the superhero I thought I was :)

This is disappointing, yes. We are not all going to be Elon Musk or Cristiano Ronaldo. We are not going to be changing the world. Most of what we do is not going to be essential, at all.

But there is a flip side to this, and some reason to rejoice.

All of our problems are average too. Going through the worst phase of your life? Feeling depressed? Tackling an addiction? Trying to reduce weight and gain some muscle? Wanting to become better at your job?

95% of our problems are being experienced by thousands and millions of people. And the thing to rejoice is the fact that there is a solution. People have solved what you are facing. People have written extensive guides on those solutions. And all of that is available at the tip of your finger. All you need to do is to go out, get that info, and apply it. Ofcourse, much easier said than done. In fact, the difficult part of most things is the implementation and following through. But who said it should be easy?

Simple - yes, easy - no. [Difficult yet simple](https://akshaychugh.xyz/writings/life/difficult-yet-simple). Simple and Solvable.
